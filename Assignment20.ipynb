    "Web scraping refers to the process of extracting data from websites. \n",
    "It involves automating the retrieval of information from web pages and saving it in a \n",
    "structured format for further analysis or use. Web scraping is typically performed\n",
    "using specialized software tools or programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "Web scraping is used for various purposes, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Extraction: Web scraping allows you to extract specific data from websites, \n",
    "such as product details, pricing information, customer reviews, or any other relevant \n",
    "information. It enables businesses to gather large amounts of data from different sources efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market Research: Web scraping is widely used for market research purposes. \n",
    "By scraping data from various websites, businesses can gather information on competitors,\n",
    "market trends, pricing strategies, customer sentiment, and other relevant data points.\n",
    "This information can then be analyzed to make informed business decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    " Here are three specific areas where web scraping is commonly used to gather data:\n",
    "\n",
    "E-Commerce and Price Comparison: Web scraping is extensively used in the e-commerce\n",
    "industry to collect product information and pricing data from various online retailers.\n",
    "Companies use web scraping to monitor competitor prices, track product availability,\n",
    "and analyze market trends. By scraping e-commerce websites, businesses can gain a \n",
    "comprehensive understanding of the market landscape and adjust their pricing strategies\n",
    "accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Financial and Investment Research: Web scraping plays a significant role in financial and\n",
    "investment research. Traders, investors, and financial analysts use web scraping to \n",
    "gather financial data, stock prices, market news, and other relevant information from\n",
    "various financial websites. This data is then analyzed to make informed investment \n",
    "decisions, track market trends, and develop trading strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real Estate and Property Listings: Web scraping is commonly used in the real estate \n",
    "industry to collect data on property listings, rental prices, and housing market trends.\n",
    "Real estate agents, investors, and property management companies scrape websites to\n",
    "extract details such as property descriptions, prices, locations, and amenities.\n",
    "This data enables them to analyze market trends, compare property prices, and identify\n",

    "small-scale scraping tasks or when the data volume is minimal. However, it is time-consuming \n",
    "and not feasible for scraping large amounts of data or scraping frequently updated websites.\n",
    "\n",

    "scraping is often used for simple data extraction tasks, such as extracting email\n",
    "addresses, phone numbers, or specific patterns of text.\n",
    "\n",
    "DOM Parsing: The Document Object Model (DOM) parsing method involves parsing the HTML \n",
    "structure of web pages using programming languages like Python, JavaScript, or PHP.\n",
    "Libraries like BeautifulSoup (Python), jsoup (Java), or Cheerio (JavaScript) provide \n",
    "convenient tools to parse and traverse HTML documents. DOM parsing enables developers \n",
    "to navigate through the webpage's elements, extract specific data based on element tags,\n",
    "classes, or IDs, and save the desired information.\n",

    "Data Extraction: Beautiful Soup offers a range of methods to extract data from HTML \n",
    "elements. It can retrieve the text content, attribute values, or even the HTML structure\n",
